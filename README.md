# AIR-POLLUTION-MONITORING-SYSTEM-BY-INTERNET-OF-THINGS
PROGRESS/ACHIEVEMENTS FOR THE WEEK :


CONCLUSION
The system is user friendly , has adequate options to access, thus, the user can exercise
various operations with the proposed system. The merits are as follows- cost effective,
easy construction of the sensors, no human intervention , no errors a simple Arduino ide
software code, portable and flexible for the further enhancement. Thus, it uploads the
data on the LCD triggers the alarm, makes the public aware , allows them to keep track
about the pollution level in their area. This showcases real quality value measurements of
air . The report has been finalized. Thus, i conclude it&#39;s a powerful technique under IOT,
in order to monitor the air pollution. Thus, future accepts would definitely improve the
existing methods and this method would prove to be an enlightment !

FUTURE WORK PLANS :
The lay forward the final analysis in a nutshell for the research.
